        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="images/david.jpg" alt="Kayumba David Pontient" class="profile-img">
        <p>My name is Kayumba David Pontient. I started at ALU in May last year, and it has been a transformative journey. Learning to code was not easy, especially JavaScript, which I found quite challenging due to its complexity and asynchronous nature. Debugging JavaScript code often felt overwhelming, but I kept pushing forward, determined to master it.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Python was an absolute joy to learn. Its simplicity and readability made coding fun, and I quickly grasped concepts like data structures and algorithms. Python boosted my confidence and reinforced my love for programming.</p>

    <!-- Vision Section -->
    <section id="vision">
        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>My mission is to leverage technology to create meaningful solutions that improve people's lives. In the next three years, I aim to develop interactive applications that help individuals dealing with anxiety and depression. My goal is to build platforms where people can easily connect with therapists, access mental health resources, and find a supportive community.</p>
        <p>I believe that technology should not only solve technical problems but also address human challenges. Through innovation and empathy, I aspire to create digital spaces that promote mental well-being and provide users with the support they need.</p>
